I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, supervised by [Dr Blesson Varghese](https://www.blessonv.com/) within the [Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/). My research focuses on distributed and privacy-preserving AI systems, aiming to make intelligent models more efficient, secure, and deployable on everyday devices. My PhD is fully funded through an industrial scholarship from Rakuten Mobile Inc., Japan.

I am also the co-founder and CTO of [LockEyeGaze](https://www.lockeyegaze.com/home), a deepfake-resistant biometric authentication system that has received £92,000 in public funding through the UK CyberASAP Year 8 programme.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as an AI researcher at Huawei’s Noah’s Ark Lab, where I developed scalable optimisation systems for vehicle routing and 3D bin-packing in large-scale logistics. Earlier, I completed a master’s degree with distinction in Data Science from the University of Edinburgh.

I’m always open to meaningful collaborations. Please feel free to get in touch.
