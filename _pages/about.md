I am currently a first-year PhD student at [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Blesson Varghese](https://www.blessonv.com/). Before the PhD journey, I was a researcher at [Noah's Ark Lab (AI Lab) at Huawei](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/), where I am applying machine learning and mathematical programming on enterprise problems. Prior to that, I obtained a master degree by distinction in [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I got research experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Before that, I graduated from the National Mathematical Training Base at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), where I built strong mathematical and statistical background.

## Research interests

I am currently interested in collaboratively training deep learning models in context of edge computing and cloud computing. 
Current collaborative machine learning (CML) techniques, e.g. federated learning and split learning, suffer from low resource utilisation during training.
During my PhD study, I am dedicated to build an efficient CML framework that accelerates CML in edge/cloud computing by exploring parallelisation techniques.
