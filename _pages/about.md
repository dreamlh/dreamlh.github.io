I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, supervised by Dr Blesson Varghese and based at the Edge Computing Hub. My research focuses on distributed and privacy-preserving AI systems, with the goal of making intelligent models more efficient, secure, and deployable on everyday devices. My PhD is fully funded through an industrial scholarship from Rakuten Mobile Inc. in Japan. I am also the co-founder and CTO of LockEyeGaze, a deepfake-resistant biometric authentication system, which has received Â£92,000 in public funding through the UK CyberASAP Y8 programme.
