## PipeLearn: Pipeline Parallelism for Collaborative Machine Learning

Collaborative machine learning (CML) techniques, such as federated learning, were proposed to collaboratively train deep learning models using multiple end-user devices and a server. However, the low resource utilisation of CML techniques makes the training process inefficient, thereby limiting the use of CML in the real-world. A novel framework PipeLearn that leverages pipeline parallelism for CML techniques is developed to substantially improve resource utilisation. A new training pipeline is designed to parallelise the computations on different hardware resources and communication on different bandwidth resources, thereby accelerating the training process in CML.  - [Github](https://github.com/dreamlh/parallel-split-federated-learning)
